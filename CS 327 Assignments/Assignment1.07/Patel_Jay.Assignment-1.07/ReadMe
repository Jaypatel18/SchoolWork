Readme for Assignment 1.07 Due Date 11/02

How to run my program:
1. In command line go to the folder where my project is located at. 
2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./rlg327 in order to generate the dungeon.

Information: In this assignment, we were suppose to parse a text file as well as parse the dice. But after parsing the file we are suppose to check for specific things that are mentioned in the assignment. For name, symb, Hp. Especially for desc you are suppose to read everything and stop when you find a full stop in the line. For HP, DAM and speed you are suppose to take out the delimeters and store them into base,dice and sides in the dice class that means you have to parse that value as well. Apart from that, for color we were suppose to store it in lncurses. For that I created a color class where I am storing all the colors as 0,1...7 with respected to the specific color.

ReadMe for Assignment 1.06 Due Date 10/26:

How to run my program:
1. In command line go to the folder where my project is located at. 
2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./rlg327 in order to generate the dungeon.

Information: In this asssignment, we were suppose to change c to c++, by that it means that I had to add extern blocks in all the header files that were necessary for this project and also had to change structs to class in some classes as well as change their extension to .cpp. After doing that we were suppose to have some getters and setters in character.cpp so that it is compieled as C++ and not C since in this project we were suppose to do C++. Later after a lot of hours of debugging and changing code we were suppose to do Fog of War by that it means that we were suppose to make sure that PC can see ahead of us within the range of 3 blocks that means the Pc has a light on his head and can be able to see and remember what the PC saw earlier. 


ReadMe for Assignment 1.05 Due Date 10/19:

How to run my program:
1. In command line go to the folder where my project is located at. 
2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./rlg327 in order to generate the dungeon.
5. Type in “./rlg327 —nummon INT value example (./rlg327 —nummon 6)” in order to see more monsters.

Information: In this assignment, we were suppose to make some keys that way the pc gets moved and see if we die or not. I have made some case statements in order to do some commands and the movements. If the PC is on the either "<" or ">" then it will generate the new dungeon by pressing "Shift + either "<" or ">" depending on the angel of it in the dungeon" with a PC and monsters in the dungeon. After you enter "m" you will see where the monsters are located at and if there are a lot of monster, in order to see all of them, using either up arrow or down arrow to view them.

2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./rlg327 —nummon INT value example (./rlg327 —nummon 6)” in order to see the output

Information: I was not able to finish this assignment due to not contributing enough time on this assignment since I had exams, I will make sure from the next time that I finish the next assignment and contribute enough time for this assignment. I got a lot of segmentation fault and fixing those spent most of my time. I am able to print out some monster but they are not moving successfully. There are couple of methods in dungeon.c that I have that will allow the main to print the dungeon. I tried doing telepathic and eratic but was not successful doing that.


ReadMe for Assignment 1.03 Due Date 09/28:

How to run my program:
1. In command line go to the folder where my project is located at.
2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./rlg327” in order to see the output

Information:
I used professor’s code for this assignment since it was easy to work on instead of implementing everything from scratch. After getting a good understanding of Professor’s code I had an idea and made a checklist all the things that I had to do in order to get this assignment done. I implemented few methods for this assignment and most of the code was taken from professor’s code since he had implemented Dijkstra. For this assignment, I ran into a lot of Seg fault and after getting help from TA, I was able to figure out all the seg faults that I got and was successfully able to run my program correctly. In this assignment there are in total of 5 methods that are added to what professor had. 

ReadMe for Assignment 1.02 Due Date 09/14:

How to run my program:
1. In command line go to the folder where my project is located at.
2. Hit “Make clean” that will clean all the executables files.
3. Type “Make” -> this will make the executable for you.
4. Type in “./Assign1.02 - - load” in order to see the output
5. Type in “./Assign1.02 - - save” in order to see the output
6. There is also a way to check my hex files if you wanted to check.

Information:
In this project, I continued writing from the previous code and made sure that it is my last code was working and I found few bugs and fixed it. After fixing the previous code I wrote some methods for the new assignment, the main method was about Load and Save, I used a lot of in build c library functions for this class. In have created a lot of structs in order for me to allocate them later in the different methods that I created for the second assignment. In this project it takes the command line arguments and check if it exists and it will print out the output accordingly to the user input. 
I have also wrote a lot of error handling in this assignment just in case if the user does not input what is required for the assignment, if the user does enter something wrong, I have printf statements that will give the error. 


ReadMe for Assignment 1.01 Due Date 09/07:

How to run my program:
STEPS: I have already created an executable for this project so please go ahead and write:
1. ./Assign1.01
	a. This will give you the output as it is showed in the PDF, after waiting for a second this will 	change the order and print our a but different that what you saw earlier.
2. Type in “make clean” in the command line and it will clean all the files that aren’t necessary.
3. Type in “Make” this will show if there are any errors in the code.

Information:
In this project I will print out some dungeons, corridors and some grid that are randomly generated. 
I used structs for this project, this struct will have width, height and size of x and y axis.
In my first method print_dung; I used for loop for row and column separately and it will print the dung as you see that I have dung[r][c] and then into the next line. room_print() in this method I am doing similar to clean_r mentioned downwards and checking by looping with row and column.
Second method is room_allocation; in this method I am checking if there are any rooms that are available in the side.
struct clean_r in this method I am looping through and checking if one side is bigger than other and if it is then it will generate the room which is the struct
clean_dung, in this method I am setting up some of the room and allocating them in the grid.
Last method, I have few methods that I made for this project that includes: corridor; in this method I will be creating corridor and making sure that they don’t overlap with each other. I used if statement and while loop in order to check few cases and looping through and checking what box is on what side
