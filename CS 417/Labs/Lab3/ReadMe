I know I am not suppose to have bin and lib folder in this project, but it messes up my % after I delete it for some reason
so I am keeping it. I am very sorry for any trouble that may have caused. 
I just didnt want to loose any points because of the % of counter.java
If you have any questions, please let me know. 

When I run my file, I do have counter.java = 100%

Thanks,
Jay Patel
