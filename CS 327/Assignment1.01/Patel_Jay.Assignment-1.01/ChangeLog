ChangeLog for Assignment1.01 Due Date: 09/07

Aug 31: I started writing the program, I read the PDF couple of time and made a checklist on what to do first and what to do in the end that really helped me.

Sept 1: I started implementing the code and made a good progress in generating struct. I also wrote a method called room_generator() in this method I initializing them by using some if else statements and using some % operator in order to get the correct numbers.
 
Sept 3: On this day I implemented 2 methods they were room_print and print_dung, in room_print while I was implementing that I ran into issue was not able to figure it out the algorithm to check if there is anything besides each other. After thinking for a bit and using stack overflow I figured out on how to solve that issue, after attempting few times I finally succeeded in making that work. In the method I am using row as my inner loop and column as my outer loop and adding a dot.
Second method that I wrote was, print_dung; in this method I made a mistake by looping through row first and then column and was getting a wrong output since it should be column first and then row. While making that I also wrote Main and started updating main side by side in order to see what are my outputs and checking if there are any errors in my logic. 

Sept 4: On this day I wrote a method called room_allocation, in this method I am checking if there is anything besides each other and if there is anything then return not true. I did that using if statement. 
I also wrote struct clean_r and clean_dung in this method, I had a very hard time figuring what side to check first and what to compare it with but after understanding it better from a TA I was was able to implement the code by taking help from the TA, I did face some of the syntax and logical errors but after debugging a bit and writing a lot of printf statements I was able to figure it out. 
In clean_dung: I made mistake and allocated different elements in different room and was getting all the wrong output but drawing it out on a piece of paper really helped me out and was able to figure it out. At last, I wrote a main in order to check my work and was printing the correct outputs.

Sept 5 and 6 : I also wrote a method where I tried to make some corridors and didn’t get it successfully, figured the math I was using was wrong and was not able to make the corridors in the correct spot. Some of them were overlapping,after taking help from the TA we figured that my math was wrong after correcting that it was working perfectly fine and we also figured that my x and y were misused and were in a wrong spot.

Sept7: I rewrote my main since i used a lot of print statements to check my work and debug the seg fault I was getting and after using valgrind I was able to figure it out (thank to stack overflow) After that I was tried debug my code and checked if all my cases were working fine as they were suppose to and make sure that there aren’t any logical errors, I also tried making my code look clean and added some comments in order to get TA’s understand my code.
